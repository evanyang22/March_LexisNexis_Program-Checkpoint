# March_LexisNexis_Program-Checkpoint
Cleaned Python Programs with supporting documentation that extract information from PDFs using pdftotext.exe

Here is a list of important information that you should be familiar with before continuing this project.

**Background information- What should you be familiar with before you start?**
1. Python coding, specifically some specific modules that I will mention below that I tend to use
os module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
-  used to interact with the operating system and run command line codes frequently, along with importing and reading files
pandas library: https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp
-  used to store and collect data, along with some analysis and cleaning

2. CSV files- a lot of information is going to be stored using csv files, so get familiar with using Python to write to them and modify them

https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html

3. pdftotext- This is where most of the issues of these programs arose from. My pdftotext output text files do not look similiar to Professor Locks pfdtotext output file. A lot of my output files were decently messy, making this task a lot more difficult because I had to add in lines that would process multiple cases and different output file formats. Honestly, if your pdftotext works very nicely, there is a good chance that the program might run perfectly cleanly without you needing to do anything.

**Set Up- How to set up and run these programs?**
1. Download and install pdftotext at https://www.xpdfreader.com/pdftotext-man.html
2. Download the programs and put them into a folder that contains all the Lexis Nexus reports in PDF version. 
3. Run the program using a commandline
Ex: python _____.py 

An output csv file should pop up in the folder when it is done. You can look at the output to see how well it performed. 

**Current state- What is the issue with these programs/What do you need to fix?**

The main issue with these programs is the uncleanliness of pdftotext. My version of pdftotext created output files that were not very similiar to the original pdf, even with the -layout option. As a result, because of all the variability, in order to get decently clean data, I had to account for not only the base case (the most common format), but also other less common variant cases (other text file formats that did not resemble the base case). However, if you are able to produce uniform output text files using pdftotext, then this task becomes exponentially easier. 


**Program Documentation: what needs to be done?**
These programs extract information from the PDF files and export it as a csv file. Most of the work comes from finding ways to extract pieces of information. 

1. ElaineDatasetCleaner- I just included this one to give you an example of how sometimes you need to create a quick program to clean up and match the data, you shouldn't really need this. You might need to do something similiar to this for the other datasets that Professor Lock gives you.
2. 1_28_23_Extractor_Master- The issue we were having here was with the date ranges. The date ranges were not lining up nicely with the addresses for me in my pdfs, and because of that, I was writing some workarounds. If your pdftotext.exe is able to create nicely formatted files, the date range issue might just go away on its own. I marked off the region of code you may need to modify with "3/26/23" (you can control + F it).
3. 2_24_CriminalFilings- This part of the project is done, I already sent Professor Lock the results so not much to do here.
4. 2_22_Voter_Registration- When I ran it, I noticed some uncleanliness in some pdf files, again this was due to the uncleanliness of pdftotext. Additionally, Professor Lock wanted some additional pieces of information extracted, so I've added a marker of "3/26/23" to indicate a region of code you may need to change.

**Jupyter Notebook: Helpful ideas**
I've been using Jupyter Notebook for basically this entire project, and I've found it super helpful. If you want here is a link to it: https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html. It basically allows you to run code in segments at a time and test individual blocks or lines.
